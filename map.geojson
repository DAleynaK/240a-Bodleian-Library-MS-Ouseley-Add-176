    "description":"In this folio from Ibrahim Sultan’s Shahnama, we start our journey into one of the most iconic texts that originated in the Middle East. The Shahnama, written by Abul-Qâsem Ferdowsi, is one of the key texts of Persian literature (Soheila, 2016). As a tale of the heroes of Persian history (Grabar, 2010), the Shahnama has become one of the key texts which define the Persian identity. Providing historic, mythological and even anthropological sources to researchers in many fields, it’s celebrated most of all for its literary value. To this day, the Shahnama is a treasure for researchers who aim to understand not just the Iranian people’s heritage, but also many other countries in the region ranging from Turkey to Pakistan. \n\n The Ibrahim Sultan Shahnama was commissioned by Ibrahim Sultan himself, who was the grandson of the great Timur, and the ruler of Southern Iran in the early fifteenth century (MET Museum, n.d.). In total, it consists of 470 folios (which are preserved), all folios created with the utmost care by its team of artists. Currently located at the University of Oxford’s Bodleian Library, the folios themselves are not in the order they were originally created in which means that this folio, listed as 240 Verso, is actually in the preface. \n \n As a part of the preface, it’s hard to tell if there is a story here at first glance. Upon further inspection, however, it becomes evident that even if there is no story from the manuscript associated with this image, the image itself tells us a lot about the societal structure of the Persian people, and perhaps even love, during the fifteenth century."},

    "description":"We start our journey into this folio by setting the time. There are no explicit statements of time in many of the stories, but in this folio we are given a detail which helps the reader to at least tell which season the scene takes place in.\n \n Located behind the gardener in the background of the folio we see a few cherry trees scattered about, one especially prominent behind the gardener. Adding to the vibrancy of the drawing with its bright colours, it brings the dimension of time into the folio. By simply looking at the cherry tree in bloom, we know now that it’s spring at the time of the drawing, helping us to draw conclusions about the scene. \n\n In Iran, the spring season passes pleasantly in most years with weather that’s perfect for outdoor activities (Climates, n.d.). The springtime being commonly associated with budding love, perhaps there is a romanticism to the scene which the artists aimed to capture. It is during this beautiful day, with cherry trees, lilies and other flowers in bloom that our scene takes place."},

    "description":"On the top left of the folio, we notice a group of ladies watching the ground from their tower. We identify the Queen by her rich green cloak, including many golden details, and her elegant headdress. Looking closer, it seems that the Queen’s eyebrows are furrowed and her lips are pursed as she gazes at the gardener. Without an associated story, it is hard to tell exactly why it is that the Queen wears such a tense expression, but it’s certainly clear that the gardener isn’t aware of her disapproval, or at least he doesn’t show his awareness. \n\n To the right of the Queen stands the handmaidens who are given plain clothing, perhaps to make it clear who the noble person is. Their gaze follows the Queen’s, the maid on the bottom right corner showing more curiosity than the others. They watch the gardener doing his work with a great focus, all of their gazes on the hardworking gardener tending the garden, with the exception of the figure on the left corner who seems to almost be hiding from the gardener. \n\n Although the Queen would be expected to be the authoritative character in this scene, we see that both the Queen and her ladies-in-waiting have their heads bowed down, reflecting the illustrator’s submissive expectations of feminine roles. This creates a point of contention between Firdousi’s depiction of female characters in the Shahnama, and the illustrations of the stories in the Shahnama. Featuring female heroes at a time when women were rarely mentioned in literature (Soheila, 2016), one may wonder if Ferdousi would have depicted the highest social ranking character with her head bowed down to the gardener too."},

    "zoom":3,
    "description":"When taking in the ladies watching the gardener, we are drawn to the only handmaiden who does not join the other ladies in watching the young gardener below. Without a story to tell readers who she is, one can call her The Exception to give her a name in our analysis.\n\n In our attempt to understand her story better, we may observe her clothing. Though the Queen is the most elegantly dressed, The Exception follows closely behind with a vibrant orange dress, decorated with golden patterns. She wears a dark blue cloak over her dress, also covered in golden detailings. Combined with the fact that her headdress is shown in as much detail as the Queen’s, it becomes clear that she is of importance in this illustration. \n\n One possibility is that she may be the first lady-in-waiting, an important role given to the highest ranking maid, and as such she may just be taking her roles very seriously, which would explain why she wouldn’t watch the strong gardener below. \n\n Another one, however, is an explanation that would fit the rich history of romances found in Persian literature. When one sees the amount of detail given to her face, even more than the Queen’s, one may wonder if there is something about her that makes her more important than the queen in the illustrator’s eyes. And what else could conquer authority but love? \n\n The artist shows a youthful blush on The Exception’s face, with a gaze that points to the ground. Could it be the case that perhaps The Exception is hiding behind a wall because seeing the gardener makes her shy? Does she aim to perhaps hide her feelings from the Gardener? \n\n The Exception as a character adds an air of mystery to the folio, making one wonder if there is a subplot of a romance in this vibrant depiction of springtime in the palace."},

    "description":"A reader who is used to reading the Latin alphabet will likely start out looking at the folio from the top left corner and end at the bottom right corner. Following this likelihood, the observation of the folio will probably end with the Gardener. \n \n Located at the bottom right corner of the folio, we see that he’s a young man from his facial hair, which includes a mustache but lacks a beard. One can further determine his social status from both the clothes he is wearing, without any special detailing on them, and his headdress, lacking any grandeur when compared to the depictions of noble characters in the Shahnameh. \n \n It is perhaps no surprise that the ladies of the court are so entranced by his performance, as we can see even from the modest drawing that the Gardener is physically fit by the sharp lines on his legs indicating a toned physique. \n \n The gardener takes his job seriously, as we see from his gaze focused on the task at hand, and there is not much that can come between him and the shovel he uses with much determination. One may wonder, however, if the gardener knows that he is being watched by the ladies above. Furthermore, if The Exception (the lady in the orange dress) is avoiding him, does he know that she’s there? At a time when interaction between the male and female gender wasn’t commonplace, it is possible that the Gardener was aware of all of these factors but simply kept his head down out of respect for, and perhaps a fear of, the king. Regardless, the characters that watch him from above seem to be getting no reaction from the Gardener."},

    "description":"In the bottom right corner of the folio, one notices a cypress tree, standing proudly behind the gardener. Cypress trees are very commonly seen in Iran, especially in Shiraz (Encyclopedia Iranica, n.d.), where Ibrahim Sultan was the governor (MET Museum, n.d.). One may suppose, however, that the choice to include the cypress tree near the gardener was a deliberate one by the artist, given the symbolism associated with cypress trees in Persian culture. \n \n Cypress trees have negative symbolic connotations in Western cultures, symbolising death for the Celts and being related to the Gods of Hell in ancient Greek and Roman mythology (Dehkordi,2017, 2). In contrast, Eastern cultures including Chinese, Jewish and Iranian cultures associate positive terms with cypress trees. In Iranian culture, a tree that does not bear fruit, and as such does not turn bare in winter is a free tree. An evergreen tree, like the cypress, is naturally a perfect example of a free tree. \n\n Apart from its association with freedom, many authors including Ferdousi have contributed to the idea of a cypress tree representing elegance, which is why we see many characters being described as like a cypress tree (Dehkordi, 2017, 3). Perhaps the illustrator sought to make use of this symbolism to draw attention to the youthful gardener.\n\n With the idea of the cypress tree’s symbolism already brought to the  attention of the viewer, it is possible that the gardener is the slender, elegant figure to be admired in the illustration. On the other hand, the illustrator may have used the symbol to draw attention to the queen in her green robe watching from the balcony, standing tall, elegant, and slender just like the cypress tree. \n\n Seeming like a minute detail, it is admirable to see how the artist used a narrative tool often utilised by Firdousi to show the aesthetic value of this stand alone scene in the preface of the Shahnama."},

    "description":"It follows naturally that no Persian illustration can be complete without hints of its iconic architecture. Though the tower in which the Queen and her handmaidens stand seems relatively standard, the Persian touch is shown in the intricate patterns adorning the tower.\n \n The most noticeable pattern is shown above the grand door of the tower. Above an opal blue background, an abstract pattern, like nearly all Islamic geometric art, is drawn in gold and white ink. At certain points, the patterns intersect, and at others the lines branch out to a leaf-like shape. \n \n The artist brings the design of the tower together by using the same pattern at the very top of the tower, encompassing the six walls of the hexagonal tower. Not only does the rich blue complement the earthy orange walls of the tower, it also adds a subtle accent to the drawing of the tower. One can imagine that this effect, which adds an element of dimensionality into the two dimensional painting, would have helped a viewer at the time immensely to visualise this tower.\n \n Although the accent patterns dominate the visualisation of the tower, it’s worth noting that there are other patterns too. For example, the tower itself has a simple pattern of triangles and a flower repeated all throughout. We also see simple accent patterns of loose swirls that feed into each other in the room in which the ladies are. Highlighted in blue along the ceiling and red around the middle accent of the room, it is clear that this is no room for a peasant. \n \n Geometrical designs in general have become the foundation for Islamic art, similar to how portraits of Jesus have driven European art forward. Though there are many reasons as to why geometric patterns became so popular in Muslim scholarship, most of the reasons can be summarised in two viewpoints. In religious doctrine, geometrical designs were preferred over visual imagery in other forms because they were free of symbolic meaning in their creation, which would avoid criticism from religious scholars (Wade, 2022). It was also thought that there was an aura of spirituality in the patterns that could stimulate the intellect and free the mind from thinking purely visually (Wade, 2022). The hints of these cultural ties to geometric patterns are evident even in illustrations that aren’t central to the plot of the Shahnama, showing the dedication the artists had to the Islamic understanding of art."},
