    "description":"In this folio from Ibrahim Sultan’s Shahnama, we start our journey into one of the most iconic texts that originated in the Middle East. The Shahnama, written by Abul-Qâsem Ferdowsi, is one of the key texts of Persian literature (Soheila, 2016). As a tale of the heroes of Persian history (Grabar, 2010), the Shahnama has become one of the key texts which define the Persian identity. Providing historic, mythological and even anthropological sources to researchers in many fields, it’s celebrated most of all for its literary value. To this day, the Shahnama is a treasure for researchers who aim to understand not just the Iranian people’s heritage, but also many other countries in the region ranging from Turkey to Pakistan. \n\n The Ibrahim Sultan Shahnama was commissioned by Ibrahim Sultan himself, who was the grandson of the great Timur, and the ruler of Southern Iran in the early fifteenth century (MET Museum, n.d.). In total, it consists of 470 folios (which are preserved), all folios created with the utmost care by its team of artists. Currently located at the University of Oxford’s Bodleian Library, the folios themselves are not in the order they were originally created in which means that this folio, listed as 240 Verso, is actually in the preface. \n \n As a part of the preface, it’s hard to tell if there is a story here at first glance. Upon further inspection, however, it becomes evident that even if there is no story from the manuscript associated with this image, the image itself tells us a lot about the societal structure of the Persian people, and perhaps even love, during the fifteenth century."},

    "description":"\"The preliminary drawings for this work were made early in the spring of 1874. After a careful consideration of the subject, it was determined to locate the point of view so that the city would be seen from the southeast, believing that to be the most advantageous in all respects. Accordingly, the point of site was established on the Illinois side of the river, looking to the northwest, and at sufficient altitude to overlook the roofs of ordinary houses into the streets. A careful perspective, which required a surface of three hundred square feet, was then erected from a correct survey of the city, extending northward from Arsenal Island...\""},

Dry and his assistants, and the faithfulness and accuracy with which this work has been done an examination of the pages will attest. Absolute truth and accuracy in the representation of the territory has been the standard and in no cases have additions or alterations been made unless the same were actually in course of construction. In a few cases, important public and private edifices that are not yet finished are shown completed, and as they will appear when done. All the buildings within the limits of the survey in July, 1875, are shown; and a very large number of those executed or commenced since that date have been also introduced, the pages having been constantly corrected up to the last possible moment before publication.\""},
