    "description":"In this folio from Ibrahim Sultan’s Shahnama, we start our journey into one of the most iconic texts that originated in the Middle East. The Shahnama, written by Abul-Qâsem Ferdowsi, is one of the key texts of Persian literature (Soheila, 2016). As a tale of the heroes of Persian history (Grabar, 2010), the Shahnama has become one of the key texts which define the Persian identity. Providing historic, mythological and even anthropological sources to researchers in many fields, it’s celebrated most of all for its literary value. To this day, the Shahnama is a treasure for researchers who aim to understand not just the Iranian people’s heritage, but also many other countries in the region ranging from Turkey to Pakistan. \n\n The Ibrahim Sultan Shahnama was commissioned by Ibrahim Sultan himself, who was the grandson of the great Timur, and the ruler of Southern Iran in the early fifteenth century (MET Museum, n.d.). In total, it consists of 470 folios (which are preserved), all folios created with the utmost care by its team of artists. Currently located at the University of Oxford’s Bodleian Library, the folios themselves are not in the order they were originally created in which means that this folio, listed as 240 Verso, is actually in the preface. \n \n As a part of the preface, it’s hard to tell if there is a story here at first glance. Upon further inspection, however, it becomes evident that even if there is no story from the manuscript associated with this image, the image itself tells us a lot about the societal structure of the Persian people, and perhaps even love, during the fifteenth century."},

    "description":"We start our journey into this folio by setting the time. There are no explicit statements of time in many of the stories, but in this folio we are given a detail which helps the reader to at least tell which season the scene takes place in.  \n\n Located behind the gardener in the background of the folio we see a few cherry trees scattered about, one especially prominent behind the gardener. Adding to the vibrancy of the drawing with its bright colours, it brings the dimension of time into the folio. By simply looking at the cherry tree in bloom, we know now that it’s spring at the time of the drawing, helping us to draw conclusions about the scene. \n\n In Iran, the spring season passes pleasantly in most years with weather that’s perfect for outdoor activities (Climates, n.d.). The springtime being commonly associated with budding love, perhaps there is a romanticism to the scene which the artists aimed to capture. It is during this beautiful day, with cherry trees, lilies and other flowers in bloom that our scene takes place.

    "description":"On the top left of the folio, we notice a group of ladies watching the ground from their tower. We identify the Queen by her rich green cloak, including many golden details, and her elegant headdress. Looking closer, it seems that the Queen’s eyebrows are furrowed and her lips are pursed as she gazes at the gardener. Without an associated story, it is hard to tell exactly why it is that the Queen wears such a tense expression, but it’s certainly clear that the gardener isn’t aware of her disapproval, or at least he doesn’t show his awareness. \n\n To the right of the Queen stands the handmaidens who are given plain clothing, perhaps to make it clear who the noble person is. Their gaze follows the Queen’s, the maid on the bottom right corner showing more curiosity than the others. They watch the gardener doing his work with a great focus, all of their gazes on the hardworking gardener tending the garden, with the exception of the figure on the left corner who seems to almost be hiding from the gardener. \n\n Although the Queen would be expected to be the authoritative character in this scene, we see that both the Queen and her ladies-in-waiting have their heads bowed down, reflecting the illustrator’s submissive expectations of feminine roles. This creates a point of contention between Firdousi’s depiction of female characters in the Shahnama, and the illustrations of the stories in the Shahnama. Featuring female heroes at a time when women were rarely mentioned in literature (Soheila, 2016), one may wonder if Ferdousi would have depicted the highest social ranking character with her head bowed down to the gardener too."},

    "description":"When taking in the ladies watching the gardener, we are drawn to the only handmaiden who does not join the other ladies in watching the young gardener below. Without a story to tell readers who she is, one can call her The Exception to give her a name in our analysis.\n\n In our attempt to understand her story better, we may observe her clothing. Though the Queen is the most elegantly dressed, The Exception follows closely behind with a vibrant orange dress, decorated with golden patterns. She wears a dark blue cloak over her dress, also covered in golden detailings. Combined with the fact that her headdress is shown in as much detail as the Queen’s, it becomes clear that she is of importance in this illustration. \n\n One possibility is that she may be the first lady-in-waiting, an important role given to the highest ranking maid, and as such she may just be taking her roles very seriously, which would explain why she wouldn’t watch the strong gardener below. \n\n Another one, however, is an explanation that would fit the rich history of romances found in Persian literature. When one sees the amount of detail given to her face, even more than the Queen’s, one may wonder if there is something about her that makes her more important than the queen in the illustrator’s eyes. And what else could conquer authority but love? \n\n The artist shows a youthful blush on The Exception’s face, with a gaze that points to the ground. Could it be the case that perhaps The Exception is hiding behind a wall because seeing the gardener makes her shy? Does she aim to perhaps hide her feelings from the Gardener? \n\n The Exception as a character adds an air of mystery to the folio, making one wonder if there is a subplot of a romance in this vibrant depiction of springtime in the palace."},

Absolute truth and accuracy in the representation of the territory has been the standard and in no cases have additions or alterations been made unless the same were actually in course of construction. In a few cases, important public and private edifices that are not yet finished are shown completed, and as they will appear when done. All the buildings within the limits of the survey in July, 1875, are shown; and a very large number of those executed or commenced since that date have been also introduced, the pages having been constantly corrected up to the last possible moment before publication."},
